I'm **Anthony David**, a cybersecurity engineer who graduated from HEIG-VD and is passionate about data protection, systems defence and the development of reliable, secure solutions.

Trained in computer engineering with a specialisation in security, I have worked on projects ranging from SIEM threat detection to RGPD compliance, via the development of Python tools.

🎯 I'm looking for a junior position or internship in cybersecurity. Curious and adaptable, I'm also open to other opportunities in IT engineering, as long as they allow me to develop in a stimulating technical environment.

I stand out for my rigour, my curiosity and my commitment to ethical and accessible technology.
