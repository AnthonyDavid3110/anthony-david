I am Anthony David, a Computer Engineer with a keen interest in cybersecurity[cite: 1]. Several years of experience as an IT technician have strengthened my mastery of IT infrastructures, client needs, and best practices essential for system management and security[cite: 2].

My current Bachelor of Science HES-SO in Computer Science and Communication Systems (with a cybersecurity specialization) at HEIG-VD is deepening my knowledge in this field[cite: 3]. I also had the opportunity to complete an international academic exchange semester at UQO - Université du Québec en Outaouais from August to December 2024, where I earned additional ECTS credits and took specialized courses in cybersecurity, cryptography, and cyber threat intelligence[cite: 5].

My professional background includes roles as an IT Support Consultant at BMS Building Materials Suisse, Technical Support Specialist at Reyl & Cie SA, and IT Technician at Varisystems SA. These experiences have allowed me to develop strong skills in user support, hardware installation and configuration, network and system administration, and IT project management[cite: 8, 9].

Outside of my studies and career, I am passionate about cybersecurity and technology. I continuously monitor technological advancements in threats and innovations, participate in specialized conferences (Insomni'hack, BlackAlps, Hackfest), and am active in CTFs and cybersecurity communities. I also served as President of the Y-CTF Ethical Hacking Club (2022-2024), where I organized CTFs, conferences, and training sessions. I am also a member of the HEIG-VD Representative Council and the Campus Commission, contributing to academic decisions[cite: 12].

My hobbies include alpine skiing, mountain hiking, and music. I am a percussionist and volunteer in communication management and organizing musical events[cite: 12].
